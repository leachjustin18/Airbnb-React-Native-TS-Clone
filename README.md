# Airbnb-React-Native-TS-Clone
A sample application based on Airbnb mobile application using react native.  This is purely for experimentation with react native. 

## Note:
This was developed using a Mac and primary testing on iPhone.  Android should also work out of the box, but not the main focus.

## Setup:

1. Go to [React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).
2. Select **React Native CLI Quickstart**.  Expo CLI Quickstart is the default.
3. Follow the steps for either macOS, Windows, or Linux.  Stop at Creating a new application.
4. Change directory(cd)  into repo(if you are not already in there).
5. In a terminal(Mac/Linux)/Command Prompt(Windows), run `npm install`.
6. Running the application:
    * **iOS**:
        * In a terminal(Mac/Linux)/Command Prompt(Windows), run `react-native run-ios`. 
    * **Android**
        * In a terminal(Mac/Linux)/Command Prompt(Windows), run `react-native run-android`.  
            * **NOTE**: You may need to hav virtual device running before trying to start the device.  If you have not already installed Android Studio and added a virtual device, this would be the time to do it.  
7. Make changes!

## Callout:
This repo is mostly influenced by watching a [YouTube Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Mr7gN6mE4&list=PLOg2mrFoc1TuKfcp4Ll-h2AFzSmujppnZ).  As I saw fit, I added extra features for my own learning.
